# prescription-scheduler

OCR with flask, to extract text from image, and then send a reminder of job/medicine on registered email/mobile no.
## what it needs :
 - flask
 - Pytesseract
 - tesseract
 - sinchsms
 - flask-uploads (for making url of images to store them in db instead of the static files)
 - And for god sake change static file path in app.py it is messed up
